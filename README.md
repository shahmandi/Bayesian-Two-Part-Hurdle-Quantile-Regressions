# Bayesian-Two-Part-Quantile-Regressions
The R code is for the article "A Bayesian Hurdle Quantile Regression Model for Citation Analysis with Mass Points at Lower Values". 
This research focuses on two challenges for the analysis of citation counts by quantile regression (QR): discontinuity and substantial mass points at lower counts, such as zero, one, two, and three. In this research, an update of a Bayesian two-part Hurdle QR model was introduced to scientometrics to address these problems. The original Bayesian two-part hurdle QR model was introduced for the case of count data with a substantial mass point at zero. It allows the zeros and nonzeros data to be modeled separately but simultaneously. For citation count data, as well as a substantial mass point at zero in some fields there can be substantial mass points at lower counts, such as ones, twos, and threes, that influence the estimation of the model. Therefore, we introduce a method to shift the hurdle forward to discard the effect of the substantial mass points on the estimation of the model for fields with many low cited articles. Articles without more citations than the hurdle are regarded as “low cited articles”. In this new update, the model enables analyses of the citation counts of low cited articles simultaneously but separately from those of the moderately and highly cited articles.It uses jittering for the citation counts greater than the hurdle to render such data continuous. The model benefits from the power of its QR portion for modeling the different quantiles of the jittered citation counts, and its logistic portion for analysing the influence of factors such as collaboration, title length, and journal internationality on the chances of an article receiving few citations. The usefulness and applicability of the method were illustrated based on both simulated and real citation count data.
